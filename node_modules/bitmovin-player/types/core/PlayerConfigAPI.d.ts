/**
 * The entry point to the player configuration is the {@link PlayerConfig} interface, which is passed into the
 * constructor of the player. There are several ways to do this:
 *
 * 1) When the full player is loaded from the CDN via `<source>` tag:
 *
 * ```js
 * const player = new bitmovin.player.Player(container, config);
 * ```
 *
 * 2) Whe the player is loaded from the CDN via {@link https://requirejs.org/|RequireJS}:
 *
 * ```js
 * requirejs(['<cdn_url>'], (bitmovinplayer) => {
 *   const player = new bitmovinplayer.Player(container, config);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * 3) When the player is imported from NPM:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Player } from 'bitmovin-player';
 * const player = new Player(container, config);
 * ```
 *
 * Example configuration:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   key: 'INSERTPROVIDEDKEYHERE',
 *   playback: {
 *     autoplay: false,
 *     muted: false
 *   },
 *   style: {
 *     width: '90%',
 *     aspectratio: '16/9',
 *   },
 *   events: {
 *     [PlayerEvent.SourceLoaded]: myFunc,
 *     [PlayerEvent.Play]: () => {
 *       // do some awesome stuff
 *     },
 *     [PlayerEvent.Error]: myErrorHandlingFunc
 *   },
 *   tweaks: {
 *     startup_threshold?: 5;
 *   },
 *   advertising: {
 *     adBreaks: [{
 *       tag: {
 *         url: 'http://your.ad.provider/manifest.xml',
 *         type: 'vast',
 *       },
 *     }],
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Example source:
 *
 * ```js
 * player.load({
 *   dash: 'https://path/to/mpd/file.mpd',
 *   hls: 'https://path/to/hls/playlist/file.m3u8',
